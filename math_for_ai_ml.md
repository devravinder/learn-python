## 🚀 Why Learn the Math?

Even though libraries like **Scikit-learn**, **PyTorch**, and **TensorFlow** abstract complexity, math is crucial for:

* **Debugging:** figuring out why a model isn’t training correctly
* **Interpretation:** understanding model behavior and outputs
* **Tuning:** adjusting hyperparameters with reasoning instead of trial and error

---

## 1️⃣ Statistics & Probability

Statistics builds the **intuition to choose the right algorithms** based on data.

### 📌 Core Concepts

* **Populations & Sampling**
* **Descriptive Statistics**

  * Mean, Median, Mode, Expected Value
* **Spread & Relation**

  * Variance → how spread the data is
  * Covariance → how two variables relate

### 🎲 Probability Fundamentals

* Random Variables
* **Probability Distributions**

  * Normal (Gaussian)
  * Binomial
  * Uniform
* **Central Limit Theorem**
* **Conditional Probability**
* **Bayes’ Theorem**
* **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**

### 📊 ML Applications

* **Linear Regression**
* **Logistic Regression**

## 2️⃣ Linear Algebra

Often called **“the language of data”** — all data (images, text, tabular) becomes vectors & matrices.

### 📌 Data Structures

| Type   | Meaning                        |
| ------ | ------------------------------ |
| Scalar | Single number                  |
| Vector | List of numbers                |
| Matrix | 2D grid                        |
| Tensor | Generalization to n-dimensions |

### 🔧 Operations & Concepts

* Matrix: addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose
* Determinant & Inverse
* Rank & Linear Independence
* **Eigenvalues & Eigenvectors**
* **Matrix Decompositions**

  * Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

### 📉 Dimensionality Reduction

* **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

---

## 3️⃣ Calculus

Essential for **optimization and model training**.

### 📌 Derivatives & Gradients

* Derivatives → rate of change
* Gradients → derivatives in multiple dimensions
  *(critical for Gradient Descent)*

### 🔍 Vector & Matrix Calculus

* Jacobian
* Hessian

### 🔗 Chain Rule

Core mathematical tool behind **Backpropagation in neural networks**

### ⚙ Optimization Understanding

* Local vs Global Minima
* Saddle Points
* Convexity
  *(influences convergence and overfitting)*
